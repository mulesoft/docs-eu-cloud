= To Create a Server (EU Control Plane)

[NOTE]
From the EU control plane, you can only create servers using Mule Runtime Agent version 1.9.2 and later. Ensure that you have installed this version in your Mule runtime environment.

To manage a remote server from the EU control plane you must run the `amc_setup` script to create a server by configuring the Runtime Manager Agent to communicate with Runtime Manager.

The procedures for creating a server are similar to those for creating a server in the US control plane. The difference is that you must use the `--region eu1` option when running `amc_setup` as shown in the following example:

----
./amc_setup --region eu1 -H 1234321xyzabc----16 your-eu-server-name
----

This flag ensures that the server connects to Runtime Manager in the EU control plane. When you click Add Server in the  Runtime Manager > Servers tab, Runtime Manager in the EU control plane automatically inserts this flag in the generated script.

== Ports, IP Addresses, and Hostnames to Allowlist

In your network, you might need to allowlist ports, IP Addresses, and hostnames of various parts of the Anypoint Platform to allow the Runtime Manager Agent in a customer-hosted Mule runtime to communicate with MuleSoft-managed Anypoint Platform APIs and services. See xref:runtime-manager::rtm-agent-allowlists.adoc[Ports, IP Addresses, and Hostnames to Allowlist] section of the To Install and Configure the Runtime Manager Agent documentation for general information.

For EU Control Plane, you must allowlist the following ports, IP addresses, and hostnames:

=== Ports
[%header,cols="2*a"]
.Ports, IP Addresses, and Hostnames to Allowlist
|===
|Name |Port
|*eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|*analytics-ingest.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |  443
|*arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.msap.io* |  443
|*runtime-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* | 443
|===

=== Static IP Addresses
There are two static IP addresses that must be allowed to access the `mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com` hostname:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
.Static IP Addresses to Allowlist
|===
|Name |IP Address
|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |18.195.19.18
|*mule-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* |18.194.245.32
|===

=== Dynamic IP Addresses
Some IP addresses used by Anypoint services are automatically assigned by the underlying cloud infrastructure, and therefore, might change in the future. For this reason, you should not implement an allowlist based on a specific IP address assigned to Anypoint services.

=== Hostnames for Layer 7 Firewall Rules
Many firewall devices allow you to define Layer 7 Firewall Rules, in which you can filter by destination name or application type.

Include the following hostnames in your Layer 7 firewall rules:

[%header,cols="1*a"]
.Hostnames Required in Firewall Rules
|===
|Hostname
|*eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com* 
|*analytics-ingest.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|*arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.msap.io*
|*runtime-manager.eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com*
|===
